  # Deep reset settings - only used if simple rotation fails
  # Set to "off" or "" to disable deep reset (faster but may not change IP)
  # Set to "mmcli" to use ModemManager (recommended for most carriers)
  # Set to "at" to use AT commands (fallback if mmcli doesn't work)

  # How long to hold modem offline during deep reset (seconds)
  # Longer = better chance of new IP, but longer downtime
  # 60-120s: Fast but may not escape CGNAT
  # 180-300s: Good balance (recommended)
  # 600s+: Maximum IP change chance but long downtime
